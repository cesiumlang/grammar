# Defines all languages known to GitHub.
#
# Required fields:
#    type                  - Either "data", "programming", "markup" or "prose".
#    ace_mode              - Ace mode used when editing files which use the language. This must match
#                            one of the names in https://gh.io/acemodes. Use "text" if no mode exists.
#    extensions            - List of associated file extensions, sorted in ascending ASCII order,
#                            except for the language's primary extension, which is always listed first.
#    filenames             - List of associated filenames, sorted in ascending ASCII order.
#                            May be omitted if the extensions field is present (and vice versa).
#    language_id           - Unique identifier used internally by GitHub, generated by running
#                            `script/update-ids`. Do not fill out this field manually.
#    tm_scope              - The TextMate scope that represents this programming language.
#                            This should match one of the scopes listed in grammars.yml.
#                            Use "none" if there is no TextMate grammar for this language.
#
# Optional fields:
#    aliases               - List of additional aliases (implicitly includes lowercased forms of language's name).
#                            These are used in fenced code-blocks, code searches by language, and in overrides.
#    codemirror_mode       - CodeMirror 5 mode used when editing files that use the language.
#                            This must match one of the names listed here: https://git.io/vi9Fx
#    codemirror_mime_type  - MIME media-type used by CodeMirror 5 for selecting a mode for editing the language.
#                            The `mime` types supported by the named mode are listed here: https://git.io/f4SoQ
#    color                 - CSS colour code used to represent the language (format: "#RRGGBB").
#    fs_name               - Filesystem name used when creating directories for the language. Only necessary for
#                            languages whose names contain symbols that are invalid or unsafe on certain systems.
#    group                 - Name of the parent language. Languages in a group contribute to the usage statistics
#                            of their parent language.
#    interpreters          - List of programs that execute the language (by running and/or compiling it).
#                            These are consulted when scrutinising a file's hashbang to determine its language.
#    wrap                  - Enable soft line-wrapping (default: false)
#
# Any additions or modifications (even trivial) should have corresponding
# test changes in `test/test_blob.rb`.
#
# Please keep this list alphabetized. Capitalization comes before lowercase.
